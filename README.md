# # Selenium with Java POM Framework for OpenCart E-com App By MUSTAPHA-QA

**## About the Project**

**### Overview**

- This project presents a comprehensive PAGE OBJECT MODEL testing framework designed to automate 'Register New Account' and 'Login' functionalities 
for OpenCart e-commerce web application, ensuring its quality and reliability.

**### Features**

- List of the key features:
  - Test cases covering the 'Home page', 'Register account' and 'Login' functionalities.
  - Data generation using excel file
  - Extent report and logging for comprehensive test results

**### Technologies Used**

- List of the technologies employed:
  - IDE: Eclipse
  - Coding language: Java
  - Test automation framework: TestNG
  - UI testing library: Selenium
  - Build and project management tool: Maven

**## Framework Structure**

- The framework's structure is organized into two folders src/test/java folder and src/test/resources folder:
   - The src/test/java folder is organized into three packages:

  - ```
    demo.opencart.pageObjects
    ```

    - BasePage class which encapsulates common methods.
    - LoginPage contains methods to interact with the login page.
    - HomePage contains methods to interact with the home page.
    - RegisterAccountPage contains methods to interact with the page for registering a new user.
    - AccountCreatedPage contains methods to validate the registration of a new user.
    - MyAccountPage contains methods to validate the login of the new registered user.



  - ```
    demo.opencart.testCases
    ```

    - TC001_HomeTest
    - TC002_RegisterAccountTest
    - TC003_LoginTest

  

  - ```
    demo.opencart.utilities
    ```

    - BrowserFactory class which encapsulates launching browser related methods.
    - ExtentReportManager class for report generation.
    - DataProviders class.
    - ReadConfig class dedicated to read data from config.properties file.
    - XLUtility class which helps reading the data from the excel file.



   - The src/test/resources folder contains the external files used for the project:
     - config.properties
     - extent-config.xml
     - log4j2.xml


**## Setup and Usage**

- Add necessary dependencies according to the pom.xml file.

**## Project Structure**

To ensure a clear and organized project structure, we've adopted the following conventions:

- Source code:
  - All project packages are located within the `src/test/java`folder, as this is the standard directory for test code in Maven projects.
- External resources:
  - The `src/test/resources` folder serves as a repository for external files essential for testing (listed above)
- Reporting:
  - We have created `reports` folder which serves as a repository for the generated extent report 
- Test data:
  - The excel file used for generating the data is located in the `testData` folder 


**## Results Achieved** 

#### Test Case Success Rates
- **Home Test:** 100% success rate
- **Register Account:** 100% success rate
- **Login:** 100% success rate

### Challenges
- **Generating a random email for registration :** The application under test imposes restrictions on using the same email for registration multiple times. To overcome this limitation, we implemented a solution to generate a unique email address by combining the email obtained from the Excel file with a randomly generated string. Subsequently, we needed to capture and store this dynamically generated email in the `config.properties` file for future use during the login process.


### Additional Observations
- All test cases were executed successfully without any failures.
- Automated tests provided comprehensive coverage of the application's tested functionalities.
- Performance of automated tests was satisfactory, with no significant delays or timeouts observed.
- Continuous integration (CI) pipelines were successfully set up with Jenkins to automate testing processes.
